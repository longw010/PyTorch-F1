Paper: Lightweight Image Super-Resolution with Information Multi-distillation Network (ACM MM 2019)

# Notes: 
- Based on the info in the github, to get similar performance, IMDN takes 0.7M while EDSR-baseline has 1.6M paramters
(EDSR has 43M params).
- The running time is similar.
- There might be some suboptimal operations in the cuda.
